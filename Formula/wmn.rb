  # brew upgrade keeps what wmn setup made (wmd, the engine folder, the agent files) in step with the new binary; it does nothing
  # for a wmn that never ran wmn setup.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      wmn needs one more step before it runs blocks: run
        wmn setup
      It fetches the wmd release this wmn is pinned to (each file checked against its pinned sha256) and starts the engine, puts the agent
      files beside the binary and builds the engine folder for browser mode. `wmn setup --remove` undoes it.
